            <h4>
                This result is the average of scores taken from tweets with the hashtag #trump for the last minute, 
                and the average score from comments in the Reddit news section, both rounded to 2 decimal places.

                I'm using TextBlob for the sentiment analysis side of things. TextBlob is a Python library for processing text data. It provides a 
                simple API for performing common NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis.
            </h4>
            <h4>
                TextBlob assigns sentiment polarity scores between -1 to +1. The closer to -1 a score is, the more negative it is. The closer to 
                +1 a score is, the more positive it is. A score of 0 means it was classified as neutral.
